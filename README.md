  The Buildpack-powered build service

# ðŸš€ Booster

This service handles image builds for the Magic Container Registry. It currently uses [kpack](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack) to handle the actual build process, but the plan is to drop that dependency in the future.

## Releasing

Before Spaceship is self-hosting, you can build an image manually with `pack`:

```sh
pack build us.gcr.io/onspaceship/booster --builder paketobuildpacks/builder:tiny
```
